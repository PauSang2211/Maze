# Maze
A personal project created during the summer of 2020. I wanted to experiment with maze generation and solving algorithms and was particularly interested in visualizing the process. 

# Goals:
* To practice object-oriented programming with Java
* To implement various maze generation and maze solving algorithms 
* To practice Java Swing and AWT for GUIs

# Overview:
A GUI will pop up and you can select the type of maze generation algorithm you want. It will generate a maze using the selected algorithm. After the maze has generated, you can select two cells and whatever maze solving algorithm you selected will be used to find a path between the two cells. 

# Note: 
This program is unfinished and glitchy. I plan to work on fixing it and adding some more algorithms in the future!
